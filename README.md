# etch-a-sketch

Even though this was a project idea from the Odin Project, this is not the result of quick copying and pasting from a tutorial. I worked on this project for two weeks of long hours, thinking, typing code whenever I had the chance, arguing with chatGPT when I needed implementations I wasn't familiar with (and ending up troubleshooting even more code from it), staying up late, and lots of testing. 
This project forced me to exceed the limits of my DOM manipulation, and gave me a challenge as my largest code base yet. All in all, it's helped me to become an even stronger front-end dvceloper.
And putting together the final feature, downloading the drawings stumped me. I asked GPT, but it gave me buggy code, leading me to meet the Odin Project community. A huge shoutout to @Jymers for the troubleshooting help!
